Game I created

I created this game in Unity
I designed a 2d platformer just like the ones I used to play as a kid.
The assets are all found online for free. 
The game includes 2d collision, a behavior tree for the player sprite and the AI turret sprite.

I have a functioning health bar, Spikes that do damage, a attack function, and a enemy AI.
